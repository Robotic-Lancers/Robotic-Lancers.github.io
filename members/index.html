                Ryan is the quiet head of code and the captain of EK for the 2021-22 season. He had previous experience doing
                competition coding, and has been a part of the team since 2020. Although he can seem quiet on the outside,
                he eventually was able to integrate well into the EK team, putting in the time to make his mark on the team.
                Common phrases you might hear him say include "oh my god". He is also the General Grevious of code, because he is a bot, like when he used a while loop during the OpMode.
                In his free time, Ryan likes bottom fragging in Valorant, vlogging, and egirls.

                Amanda is the head of build and the other captain of EK for the 2021-22 season. Ironically, Amanda is bad
                at using technology and is even more gullible, falling for every prank the team plays on her, like when she got pranked into making 3D alliance markers.
                When Amanda
                drives the robot, the robot spends more time crashing into the wall than scoring points. Ally Mintz is her role model.
                When team members are misbehaving, she will lock them in time out closets. She is also the member that actually
                continued to log what she did at meetings even when everyone else stopped.
                In her free time, Amanda likes to sew and do crafts.

                current member of EK who has gone to a normal in person competition and has a ceiling fetish for the robot. He is part
                of the self created Jew Duo, along with Amanda whom he dragged into it. Ryan has a overwhelming fear of one day
                being kidnapped and brought to a warehouse where he will be forced to do logbook. In his free time, he
                likes to correct people's grammar on Discord when writing Ryans and get clapped by Olivia in word searches.
                When he grows up, he wants to be an architectural engineer.

            Preston was THE builder for EK from 2016 to 2020. During the 2018-2019 season, Preston also served as captain.
            His ideas, along with David's, were fundamental to almost all of the build that happened on the team.
            He was never too serious, yet was still productive. He ensured the bot would be finished before a competition, and if it wasn't,
            he was willing to build the entire thing the night before.
            He also served as a valuable leader to the team, both when he was a captain and when he was not. He made sure
            everyone had something to do, and ensured that his knowledge was passed on. He also gifted all of us saftey glasses.

            Gene was the code lead for EK from 2016-2020. He served as a both patient and skilled coder who often put code on his back and
            came up with much of the framework of the team's current code. He offered a wealth of creative ideas to those
            who worked with him about ways to make controls more intuitive and found different resources to help elevate the team's code.
            It was under his recommendation for the team to pursue looking into PID feedback loops and for the team to adopt a new path planning method.
            He also served as captain for the 2019-2020 season. His coaching on during competition was also legendary. "If the robot doesn't hang, then I'll hang"
            In his free time, Gene likes to main McCree in Overwatch or swim.

            David was a builder and cadder for EK from 2016 to 2020. There was almost no one who cared as much about the
            team as he did, and as such he really wanted to see the team succeed. He often had a brutally honest, touch
            love way of teaching and giving feedback, which did not beat around the bush and made everyone try their best to work harder and fix any
            weaknesses David presented. He also made members try to figure out solutions on their own, instead of telling them explicitly what to do.
            In the end, everyone who has had the opportunity to work with him became smarter team members because of
            it. David also had a weird obsession with setting things on fire.

            Janice was the head of outreach, finance and logbook from 2017-2019. She has a background in fabrication and AutoCAD from BEST Robotics. Her creative thinking and adroit business-sense kept EK very
            organized and timely with deadlines and sponsorships. Her idea to digitize our logbook put us ahead of the
            curve before it became common to do so. She also spent time making our pit decorations. She was also a really
            easy person to get along with, and her energetic way of speaking helped her be a fun person to talk to. She
            also made sure everyone was in bed on time during worlds and could carry in Pokemon Go raids.

            Anna was a builder and head of logbook from 2016-2019. Prior to doing FTC, she did VEX. She was team captain from 2018-19, and her expertise in both
            build and architectural design and planning even carried the team to Worlds’ when she was captain by getting us the Think Award.
            She managed logbook, setting up forms for attendance and creating lists of things that had to be done before worlds and who was doing it.
            Easily the most cracked member EK has ever had. She also spent time making pit decorations, was willing to dedicate time to teach and explain things to all the new members,
            and spent loads of time trying to get more girls into STEM at various outreaches. Truly a Renaissance woman.

            like one in Warren NJ, where she had a personality perfect for working with children. Her optimism and presence
            made her a strong morale boost for the team, where she could easily bring up the mood of the team.
            Katrina also participated in Track, where she was a hurdler.

            coding in robotics using things like motors, sensors, and servos. His code served as the earliest template
            in many seasons, and is still used to teach freshman now. His dedication to the robot meant he would often
            stay up late in a hotel room at worlds, running the autonomous one more time to make sure it worked well.
